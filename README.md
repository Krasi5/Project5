 Purpose of the GymPlus website

GymPlus is a fitness-oriented website, created as a Milestone Project 1 for a Web Development course.
The aim is to provide a range of physical exercises, in a friendly environment with support of individual's abilities. Proper nutrition is a part of physical and mental well-being as well as the opportunity to accommodate the needs of the young family members, while the people exercising.

    Navigation Bar 
   
It consists of a logo sign and three pages - Home, Features, and Testimonials plus the Sign In button, which gives a connection to the required information. It is responsive to different viewports and  accommodates the minimal space. The bar changes to a hamburger icon in small devices and collapses to allow access. I wanted and tried to change it to gold color, however I did not manage to overcome the anchor tag to do it.


Landing page

It consists of a picture with the motto, which conveys the purpose of the site. 
There is an dicount advertise, encouraging the visitors to have a trial. The Sign Up button open a box for personal details needed .
  

Features page 

It represents the services provided, divided into four sections. A picture was used to provide the corresponding color and make the page more interesting. 

Testimonials 

The page presents the opinions of four people. The text was wrapped in rectangles in an order different than the previous page which was a problem in a smaller size as the height was set at 60vh.
